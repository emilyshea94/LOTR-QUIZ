# LOTR-QUIZ

For this challenge I have designed a quiz only a true Lord of the Rings fan could ace!!! 
One quiz to rule them all....
Each question is pertaining to the vast world of Middle Earth writen by J.R.R Tolkien. 
This one really put me through the ringer but I used a lot of online recourses to help me figure this out. 
My original style.css was a bit different but it wasnt showing correcly on my index.html so i changed it completely. 
I tried to add breaks inbetween each question but everytime I did it messed up the whole code and ruined my countdown timer and high sscore feature. 
I know this is something ill need to work on in the future and Im going to take some time soon to master this. 
I also could not get the timer to subtract time when the answer was wrong, but when all questions are answered it stops the timer. 
My favorite thing about this assigment was being able to make something that pertains to my interest. I also loved trying out the "Medieval Font"
I hope to be able to make something like this in the future with more Medieval flare in the styling.
